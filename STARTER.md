# STARTER KIT 2025

## Description

This comprehensive full‚Äëstack starter kit is built for rapid development of modern web applications in 2025. It combines the power of Next.js‚ÄØ15 with React‚ÄØ19 for the frontend, FastAPI with Python for the backend, and PostgreSQL for data persistence.

Out of the box, it includes a solid foundation with authentication, internationalization (i18n), testing, and deployment infrastructure fully configured.

The architecture follows a hybrid approach: Next.js handles the primary web application, server‚Äëside rendering, and API routes, while FastAPI serves as a dedicated backend for complex business logic and background job processing (powered by RQ). This design offers flexibility to support everything from simple MVPs to complex enterprise applications.

Built with developer experience in mind, the kit features modern tooling, a complete testing setup, and production‚Äëready containerization. It‚Äôs crafted to help startup teams go from idea to deployment quickly ‚Äî without compromising code quality or scalability.
